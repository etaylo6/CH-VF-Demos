# Beam_CH_Demo

This demo uses capabilityies that are established in ConstraintHG (https://github.com/jmorris335/ConstraintHg) for the upcoming paper Agentic Selection of Valid Multi-Fidelity Models.

subgraph_testing.py used to validate how many executable models are found in the graph.

visualized_agent.py shows how this methodology can be used to flexibly represent the system for all possible models.
